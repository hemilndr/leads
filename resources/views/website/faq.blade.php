                    Hypnosis is a state of mind characterized by relaxed brain waves and a state of hyper- suggestibility. It is a state of inner absorption, concentration and focused attention. When our mind is concentrated and focused, we are able to use it more powerfully. Hypnosis helps people to use more of their potential.

                    Therapeutic and healing practice of Hypnosis has an ancient origin. We can see the application of Hypnosis in Holy Scriptures and ancient texts in different names. It is evident that the phenomenon itself must have been know to mankind and indeed made use of it without proper awareness about it.

                    Hypnosis was known as “mesmerism” for a very long time. Austrian physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) was the propagandist of Mesmerism. Mesmer believed that he could cure his patients with his innate power which he called  "animal magnetism". He believed that he could transmit the magnetic power to his clients with the “mesmeric pass”.  Though he was misconceived, his approach was true psychological.  However his occult like practices worked, if not for the reasons he thought it did.  To sum up, his irrational theory leads to the development of scientific hypnosis.

                    <br><br>
                    An Indo-Portuguese priest, Abbe Jose Custodia Faria (1756 – 1819), is the person who revived public attention to animal magnetism by giving demonstrations in Paris without the use of any equipments .  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it worked by the power of expectancy and cooperation of the patient, now known as suggestion. The statue of Abbe Jose Custodia Faria, hypnotizing a woman  is positioned in a small square just near the Secretariat in Panjim, Goa, India .Abbe Faria is fondly remembered as a pioneer in hypnotherapy.

                    <br><br>

                    Mesmer's theories become the motivating force for some enterprising physicians in that era. A number of clinicians with  enquiring minds made use of it without fully understanding the phenomenon. Later  Scottish physician, James Braid (1795-1860) thoroughly investigated the phenomenon scientifically and coined the terms hypnotism and hypnosis, after the Greek god of sleep, Hypnos.

                    <br><br>

                    The two towering figures lived in nineteenth century Milton H. Erickson (1901-1980), and Dave Elman (1900-1967) are the forerunners in moderninsing Hypnothereapy. Hypnosis in 21st centrury is built in the strong foundation stone laid down by Erickson and Elman who followed solution focused practice using rapid or indirect techniques different from the lengthy induction methods of the 19th century.

                    Hypnosis is just in comparable with relaxation. During the trance you are not immobilized or paralyzed. You can change your sitting position, scratch yourself, sneeze or cough. During the trance you can still hear sounds around you, for example the phone ringing.You will be relaxed and mentally stable in the state.

                    No, Hypnosis is a completely natural state, it is pleasant and relaxing. Hypnosis has been used for thousands of years to effectively speed up healing and relieve stress symptoms. Hypnosis has nothing to do with magic wands and occult abilities. As a matter of fact, hypnosis is completely normal, non-magical and with predictable consequences. It's totally out of the question for a person to be mastered, manipulated or put in a trance against his/her will.

                    Self-hypnosis is when you hypnotize yourself. Learning self-hypnosis is the ultimate act of self-control. This is often more practical as a stress management tool than normal hypnosis. The relaxation achieved with self-hypnosis can be intense. Unlike meditation, affirmations are used as part of self-hypnosis to manage stress and build self-confidence. Affirmations are the positive statements that we make to ourselves to counter stress and unpleasant situations in life.
                    <br><br>
                    As a matter of fact, all Hypnosis is really self hypnosis. Children are often in a state of self-hypnosis when they are playing imaginary games. Actors and athletes often use it to improve their performance. Because people are open to suggestion while in a hypnotic state, they can learn to change their thoughts, feelings, behaviour and attitudes.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of everyday states of being in hypnosis are daydreaming, immersed when reading a book ,watching a movie etc. Self-hypnosis can be used as a part of a daily stress management routine.

                    People often fear that being hypnotized will make them lose control, surrender their will, and result in their being dominated, but a hypnotic state is not the same thing as gullibility or weakness. Many people perceive these wrong idea about hypnotism on stage acts. Stage acts help to create a myth about hypnosis which discourage people from seeking legitimate hypnotherapy. In a stage setting, the person who volunteers is comfortable in front of  audience. They are highly suggestible , and ready for the “role play”. Stage hypnotists are performers and they will take full advantage of the social pressures and group dynamics of the clients. Therapeutic hypnosis in clinical setting is entirely different from stage hypnosis . Clients who consult with a hypnotist do not come for entertainment.  They are in the consulting room for their own burning personal problems.
                    <br><br>
                    The fact is that in hypnosis, the client is not under the control of the hypnotist. Hypnosis is not something imposed on people, but something they do for themselves. A hypnotist simply serves as a facilitator to guide them.

                    Hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion have played a major role in healing thousands of people. Recent research supports the view that hypnotic communication and suggestions effectively change aspects of the persons physiological and neurological functions.
                    <br><br>
                    Therapeutic Hypnosis can be used to treat a wide variety of issues. There is convincing evidence that Hypnotherapy can effectively be used in pain relief, overcoming addictions, fears and phobias, stress and anxiety, performance enhancement, surgery preparation...etc
                    <br><br>
                    Hypnosis will be optimally effective when the patient is highly motivated to overcome a problem and when the hypnotherapist is well trained in both hypnosis and in general considerations relating to the treatment of the particular problem. It is important to keep in mind that hypnosis is like any other therapeutic modality. It is of major benefit to some patients with some problems, and it is helpful with many other patients, but it can fail, just like any other clinical method.
                    <br><br>
                    Modern Hypnotherapists use Hypnosis not only for medical purposes but also as an aid for the solution of many problems of psychological origins. It is estimated that approximately 85% of people of all age groups will readily respond to clinical Hypnotherapy.
