                <p style="line-height:31px;font-size:15px;">
                  Rahim Marunnoorwas born on 4 th December 1946 at Cheruvakkal , Kollam, Kerala. He was born in a Syrian Christian family as the first child to his parents Pastor J Varghese and Rachel Varghese . Influenced by Pentecostal belief Eyeroor’s father and mother decided to dedicate their life for missionary work in Eyeroor’s childhood. His parents knowingly embraced poverty by abandoning their agricultural land and plenty of live stocks they posses. They migrated to Thrissur for missionary work with little Eyeroor and his younger siblings. Eyeroor was nine years old when all these happened.

                  The sudden switching to extreme evangelism traumatized Eyeroor’s mind. All avenues for his childhood entertainment were permanently closed in the hard decision took by his parents. His parents turned back to all entertainment in their life. Eyeroor was also forced to become a missionary in the childhood. Rigorous religious indoctrination and poverty, which he had not experienced earlier, landed him in agony. So many questions sprouted in his mind. He has been taught that, the path to heaven is only open for those who practice Pentecostal belief. Doubting Eyeroor, once asked his father, “Appacha, will Mahathma Gandhi go to heaven when he die”? Being a Gandhian and congress fellow traveller, his father could not give a satisfactory answer to Eyeroor. This question added fuel to his thought.

                  His turbulent mind becomes sceptic about religious scriptures and teachings. His only avenue to read and realize was his school mate Sunny, who gave him books and magazines to read. During this period they happened to meet A.V Jose ( Yukthivicharam Josettan) a veteran atheist in Trissur. A.V Jose could impress the duo with his knowledge in world religions and materialistic thought. He is the person who planted the first seeds of atheism in Eyeroor's mind . During these turbulent days once, Eyeroor got severe punishment from his school for his academic negligence. The teacher who punished him was his family friend. Terror of further punishment from his father, worried him. He didn’t return home after school. Fear of punishment forced him to run-off from Thrissur leaving his kith and kin. As a voracious reader, the characters in the novels he read on those days influenced him a lot .As an ardent Vaikkom Muhammed Basheer enthusiast , it was Majeed the protagonist in the novel Balyakala Sakhi gave him motivation for this escapade . In the novel, Majeed ran away from his home fearing punishment from his father. Eyeroor’s aimless journey ended in Bombay . Life in the mega city with colossal buildings and notorious underworld taught him several lessons at the age of 15. He did several odd jobs for his survival. However, the struggles he underwent were not harsh enough to douse his craving for knowledge. He struggled a lot to get malayalam books and magazines which were rare stuff in those days in Bombay. He starved and collected money to purchase books and magazines. After a year of struggling in Bombay, he realized the fruitlessness of his existence in the large city. He packed his bag of books and returned to Trissur where his friends and parents were living.

<h3><br>Creating space in the mental health scenario of Kerala </h3> <div class="line"></div>

                 <p style="line-height:31px;font-size:15px;">
                  In 1990's Mangalam weekly under the ownership of the great visionary and philanthropist MC Vargheese , serialized Johnson Eyeroor's case diary . Popularity of Rahim Marunnooras a hypnotist reached zenith in those days. Eyeroor become the authoritative voice of hypnotherapy in Kerala. Mangalam was printing around 14 lakh copies per week in those days. The incidents in the case diary of Eyeroor , was widely discussed by common man who were the lion share of “Mangalam” readers in those days. Misunderstanding, hypnotherapy as a universal panacea for all mental disorders people thronged in his clinic from dawn to dusk. It was a Himalayan task for him to pacify and convince the relatives and friends of psychiatric patients that hypnotherapy is not the treatment method for psychiatric disorders. He never exploited ignorance of the gullible minds and he made use of every chance to unveil the shroud of mysticism around hypnosis. He knowingly avoided the gimmicks like “hypno-pendulum” , “hypno-disc”, “dim-light hypnosis chamber” and “western attire” during his entire career as Therapeutic hypnotist . In every sense, Eyeroor was the first open-handed hypnotist of Kerala.
